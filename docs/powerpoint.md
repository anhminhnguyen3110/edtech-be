# PowerPoint generator

This architecture outlines a system designed to automate the generation of **PowerPoint presentations** for teachers using **AI-powered code generation**. The entire process is initiated by the teacher, and various components work together to deliver the final presentation while ensuring error handling, real-time feedback, and system notifications. Below, I provide a breakdown of how each component interacts to achieve this functionality.

### 1. Teacher Request and Lesson Service

The process begins when the **teacher** submits a request for a lesson in the form of a PowerPoint presentation via the **Lesson Service**. This service acts as the entry point for the system, receiving the teacher’s request and then orchestrating the rest of the pipeline to fulfill it.

- The teacher sends a request, which is followed by a **streamed response** that keeps the teacher updated on the progress of the request.
- The **Lesson Service** submits a job to the **Job Handler Service** to manage the generation of the PowerPoint.

### 2. Job Handler Service and AI-Powered Code Generation

Once the job is submitted, the **Job Handler Service** communicates with the **Language Model**, which is likely an AI model like GPT, to generate the **Python code** that will be used to create the PowerPoint. This step is crucial because the Language Model translates the teacher’s request into executable code.

- The **Language Model** receives a prompt from the **Job Handler Service**. This prompt is based on the input provided by the teacher, such as lesson requirements or content.
- The Language Model generates the **Python code** needed to create the PowerPoint. This code is then passed through a validation process to ensure its correctness.

### 3. Code Validation and Error Handling

Before the generated Python code is executed, it is validated to ensure that it will perform the expected tasks without issues.

- The **Validator** checks the Python code for any logical or syntax errors. If the validation passes, the code proceeds to the execution phase.
- If the validation fails, the code is sent to the **Error Handler**, which formats and notifies the teacher of the errors, giving them feedback about what went wrong.

In the event of a **compiling error**, the system will handle the error gracefully and notify the teacher using the **Notifier** service. This feedback loop ensures that the teacher remains informed about the status of their request, whether it's progressing smoothly or encountering issues.

### 4. Code Execution and PowerPoint Generation

Once the Python code is validated, it is compiled and executed to generate the PowerPoint.

- The validated Python code is executed either locally using a **Python environment** or via a **Serverless Cloud Function**, which allows the system to scale easily based on demand.
- During the execution phase, the system generates a PowerPoint file based on the code output. This step might include adding slides, text, images, and other relevant educational materials to the presentation.

### 5. File System and Notification

The generated PowerPoint is saved in the **File System Main Area**, which acts as the system’s storage for files and resources.

- After the PowerPoint is generated, it is stored in the File System, allowing the teacher to retrieve it later.
- The system uses the **Notifier** service to inform the teacher that the PowerPoint is ready for download. This notification ensures that the teacher is kept up-to-date in real-time.

### 6. Error Handling and Notifications

If any errors occur during the generation process, whether during code validation or compilation, the **Error Handler** ensures that the teacher is notified about the problem, allowing them to make changes or request a new attempt.

- The **Notifier** service communicates with the teacher, sending real-time updates about the status of their request.
- If the generation process is successful, the teacher is informed that the PowerPoint has been saved and is ready for download. If errors occur, detailed information about the failure is sent back to the teacher.
