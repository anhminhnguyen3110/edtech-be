# Micro-services architecture

![image.png](../images/image%2011.png)

- **API Gateway Service**:
    - Centralized entry point for all client interactions (mobile, web).
    - Handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing.
    - Alternatives: **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** or direct microservice communication.
- **RabbitMQ**:
    - Message broker enabling asynchronous communication between services.
    - Simplifies task management and service decoupling.
    - Alternatives: **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput, event-driven architectures.
- **Job Handler Service**:
    - Manages background tasks like file processing and quiz generation.
    - Prevents these tasks from blocking other services.
    - Alternatives: Serverless architectures like **AWS Lambda** for reduced management overhead.
- **File System (Stage Area & Main Area)**:
    - Handles temporary and permanent file storage.
    - Alternatives: **Cloud-based storage** (AWS S3, Azure Blob) for better scalability.
- **Cache**:
    - Speeds up frequently accessed data, improving performance.
    - Alternatives: **Redis** or **Memcached**, with Redis offering advanced features like persistence.
- **Quiz Service**:
    - Facilitates AI-generated quizzes for student assessments.
    - Could be split into smaller microservices as complexity increases.
- **Assignment Service**:
    - Handles assignment submissions, grading, and issue extraction via AI.
    - Can scale by dividing into more specialized microservices.
- **Chat Service**:
    - Real-time support with web searches and file processing.
    - Alternatives: WebSocket-based solutions (SignalR) for enhanced real-time communication.
- **Vector Database**:
    - Stores AI embeddings and vectorized data for personalized learning.
    - Alternatives: **Pinecone**, **FAISS** for scalable similarity search.
- **Relational Database with Replicas**:
    - Provides high availability, consistency, and fault tolerance for data storage.
    - Alternatives: **NoSQL databases** (MongoDB) or **distributed databases** (CockroachDB) for unstructured data needs.
- **API Gateway Pattern**:
    - Simplifies service interaction, security, and routing.
    - Alternatives: **Saga Pattern** for managing distributed transactions or **Event-Driven Architecture** for real-time service updates.
- **RabbitMQ vs Kafka**:
    - RabbitMQ: Suitable for task queues, low-latency message routing.
    - Kafka: Better for high-throughput, real-time event streaming and logging.
- **Potential Improvements**:
    - Use **serverless** for tasks (e.g., Job Handler).
    - Adopt **CQRS** or **event sourcing** for scalability and performance.
    - Implement **service mesh** (Istio/Linkerd) for better communication management and observability between services.
