This architecture is designed to build a **Intelligent Educational Question Answering Assistant** for the education domain, using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. The design integrates several advanced techniques, including **HyDE**, **CRAG**, and **Fusion RAG**, to enhance the system's ability to handle complex queries and provide accurate, domain-specific responses. Below is an explanation of the workflow and components involved in this architecture:

### 1. Query Handling and Expansion

- **Initial Query**: The workflow starts with the user's **Query**, which represents the information or question that the user is seeking an answer to. The system processes this input to ensure that it can generate an accurate and comprehensive response.
- **Query Expansion**:
    - We employ **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding)** to enhance the query by generating hypothetical examples or expansions of the query to better capture its intent. This ensures that the system can retrieve more relevant documents during the search process.
    - Simultaneously, a **Stepback Prompting** mechanism is used to re-evaluate the query, improving the system's ability to generate sub-queries that capture different dimensions of the original query. This is particularly useful for educational queries that may have complex, multifaceted answers.
- **Sub-Queries**: The query expansion process generates multiple sub-queries that are sent forward to the information retrieval system to gather relevant data from a variety of sources.

### 2. Information Retrieval

- **Dense Retriever (Ada-002)**:
    - One of the key components for information retrieval is a **Dense Retriever**, which uses embeddings to search for semantically relevant documents. This retriever, powered by **Ada-002** (likely an advanced transformer model), focuses on finding documents with high semantic relevance to the expanded queries.
- **Sparse Retriever (BM25)**:
    - In parallel, a **Sparse Retriever (BM25)** is used to search for documents based on keyword matching. BM25 is a traditional information retrieval algorithm that ranks documents based on term frequency and document length. This provides a complementary method to dense retrieval, improving the breadth of the results.
- **Vector Database**:
    - The system utilizes a **VectorDB** to store and retrieve vector embeddings of documents. The **retrievers** pull data from this vector database, ensuring that both dense and sparse representations of documents are considered in the retrieval process.
    - The database is dynamically updated through integration with **Airflow** for **real-time data serving**, ensuring the latest information is available for retrieval.

### 3. Fusion and Re-ranking

- **Fusion and Re-rank**:
    - After retrieving the results from both the dense and sparse retrievers, a **Fusion and Re-rank** process takes place. This step combines the retrieved documents from the various sub-queries and applies a ranking mechanism to prioritize the most relevant information. The fusion process is essential for aggregating the best insights across different sources, ensuring that the results are not biased by any single retrieval method.

### 4. Response Generation and LLM as Judge

- **Generate**:
    - Once the fusion and re-ranking are complete, the system proceeds to **Generate** a response. The **Large Language Model (LLM)**, such as GPT, uses the re-ranked results to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate answer to the user's query. This generated response draws from the most relevant educational content identified during retrieval.
- **LLM as Judge**:
    - At this stage, the **LLM** also plays the role of a **Judge**. The model evaluates whether the generated response is sufficient based on the retrieved information. If the response lacks completeness or depth, the LLM can trigger an additional **Internet Search** to fill any gaps in the knowledge or provide supplementary information from external sources. This ensures the system delivers high-quality responses even if the internal database lacks certain details.

### 5. Internet Search and Final Response

- **Internet Search**:
    - If the LLM determines that the internal knowledge base does not have sufficient information, an **Internet Search** is triggered to gather additional content. This step ensures that the application can answer a wide range of queries, even those outside the pre-existing domain knowledge base.
- **Final Response**:
    - Once the necessary data is retrieved, and the system generates a complete and well-rounded answer, the final **Response** is sent back to the user. This response is accurate, domain-specific, and tailored to the educational context of the query.
