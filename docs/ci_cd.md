# CI/CD pipeline

### **1. Development (VSCode)**:

- **Developers** use **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**, a widely used code editor for writing, editing, and debugging code for the *EdTech Assistant* project. This IDE provides various extensions and integrations, such as Git for version control and Docker for container management, which streamline the developer experience.
- In this stage, developers work on new features, bug fixes, or optimizations. Once development is complete, the code is ready for the next stage: version control.

### 2. **Commit Code (App Repository)**:

- After completing the code changes, developers push their code to the central **App Repository**, managed using **Git** (likely hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
- Committing code ensures that all changes are version-controlled and traceable, allowing the team to keep track of modifications and enabling collaboration across the development team. Every time code is pushed or merged into a specified branch (like `main` or `develop`), it triggers the CI/CD pipeline, starting with GitHub Actions.

### 3. **Trigger (GitHub Action)**:

- The commit event automatically triggers a **GitHub Action**, which is an automation tool built into GitHub to facilitate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). GitHub Actions allow developers to define custom workflows that automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying the application.
- In this case, GitHub Action pulls the latest code from the App Repository and begins executing predefined tasks such as building a Docker image and running tests.

### 4. **Build Image**:

- As part of the **build phase**, GitHub Actions takes the application code and packages it into a **Docker image**. Docker images contain everything the application needs to run, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
- The use of Docker ensures that the application will run consistently across different environments, from development machines to production, by encapsulating all dependencies within the image.
- Docker also allows for containerized deployment, which is particularly useful when running applications in **Kubernetes** clusters.

### 5. **Jest Unit Testing**:

- After building the Docker image, GitHub Actions runs **Jest** unit tests to ensure that the code is functioning correctly and that no new bugs were introduced. Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications and is used to validate the correctness of individual components and functions.
- By incorporating unit tests in the pipeline, we catch potential issues early in the process before the code is deployed to production. If tests fail, the pipeline stops, preventing faulty code from progressing further down the pipeline.
- Successful tests allow the pipeline to proceed to the next step, ensuring code quality and stability.

### 6. **Push Image to Docker Hub (Docker Image Registry)**:

- After successful testing, the Docker image is pushed to the **Docker Hub** (or any other Docker image registry). Docker Hub serves as a centralized repository for Docker images, where they can be stored and accessed by different environments (e.g., development, staging, and production).
- This step is a crucial part of **Continuous Integration** because it ensures that the latest version of the application, along with all necessary dependencies, is available for deployment at any time.
- By storing the image in a registry, other systems (such as Kubernetes clusters) can pull and run the exact version of the application defined by the image.

### 7. **Build Kubernetes Manifest**:

- In parallel, GitHub Actions generates or updates a **Kubernetes manifest** file. A Kubernetes manifest defines the desired state of the application when deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, including the number of pods, services, resource limits, environment variables, and more.
- The manifest file is essentially a blueprint for Kubernetes that instructs the cluster how to deploy the Docker container in a production environment. The **Kubernetes manifest** allows for efficient scaling, high availability, and fault tolerance by defining how Kubernetes manages the application.

### 8. **Pull Image (Azure Kubernetes Cluster)**:

- Once the Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS)** pulls the image based on the instructions in the Kubernetes manifest. AKS is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Azure that allows for the easy deployment and scaling of containerized applications.
- The Kubernetes cluster ensures that the application is deployed and running according to the desired state defined in the manifest. This includes setting up replicas of the application in multiple pods to ensure availability, balancing incoming requests, and managing resource consumption to optimize performance.
- By leveraging Kubernetes, the system is highly scalable and resilient, capable of handling increased traffic or failures through automatic replication and self-healing.

### 9. **Continuous Delivery (Azure Kubernetes)**:

- The final step in the pipeline is **Continuous Delivery**, where the Kubernetes cluster ensures that the latest version of the application is deployed to production. By automating this process, the CI/CD pipeline ensures that any code committed to the repository that passes all tests and build stages is quickly and efficiently delivered to end users.
- Continuous Delivery removes manual intervention, reduces human error, and accelerates the delivery of new features or fixes, improving the overall development velocity. This approach also encourages frequent small updates rather than large, risky releases.

### Additional Benefits and Potential Enhancements:

- **Security Scanning**: Security scanners such as **Trivy** or **Clair** could be added to the pipeline to ensure that the Docker image does not contain vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies. This would ensure that every image pushed to Docker Hub is secure and compliant with best practices.
- **Canary Releases or Blue-Green Deployment**: Kubernetes can be further enhanced by implementing advanced deployment strategies like **canary releases** or **blue-green deployments** to gradually roll out new versions of the application, ensuring that if any issue arises, it can be quickly rolled back without affecting all users.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: To manage the infrastructure provisioning for Kubernetes and Azure services, **Infrastructure as Code** tools such as **Terraform** or **Pulumi** could be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. This would ensure that the infrastructure itself is version-controlled and can be automatically provisioned alongside application deployments.
